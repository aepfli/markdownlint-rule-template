# This is a test markdown file

The JSON-file with the same name contains the configuration.

As soon as you run

```console
npm run test
```

this test will be executed, based on this file.

You can mark violations on lines with `{}` around the rulename like on line 16.
Or you can mark violations on other lines with `{<rulename>:<line>}`.

e.g. this rule is currently errornous {<names>}

You might need to update your snapshots from time to time :).
